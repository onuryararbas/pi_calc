# Pi_Calc #

PiCalc is code that tries to calculate pi. This idea was recommended by my friend one day, and together we mathematically defined pi
by choosing random numbers and checking the probability of it being within a certain region (check diag.png for more info). I then moved forward with the idea to make a calculator that solves it for me, rather than doing it by hand, as doing it by hand tends to be more tedious as the precision of pi increases with the number of runs of the program.
